/*
 Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).
 
 Example 1:
 
 Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
 Output: 3
 Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3.
 Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4.
 
 Example 2:
 
 Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
 Output: 1
 Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1.
 
 Note: Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.

/*
 
 Given an array with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.
 
 We define an array is non-decreasing if array[i] <= array[i + 1] holds for every i (1 <= i < n).
 
 Example 1:
 
 Input: [4,2,3]
 Output: True
 Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
 
 Example 2:
 
 Input: [4,2,1]
 Output: False
 Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one element.
 
 Note: The n belongs to [1, 10,000].
